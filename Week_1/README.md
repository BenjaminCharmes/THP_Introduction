<h1 align="center">Week 1 of The Hacking Project: Introduction to the code week !</h1>

The first two days are an introduction to our training. We meet the community, then we spank our first web pages in HTML / CSS. On the second day, we will see the layout by doing our first big project: the recreation of the Google homepage!

Over the next three days we'll see how to get a site online with GitHub, a powerful project collaboration tool. We'll also look at Terminal, a powerful tool that developers use. We'll see how to make mobile-friendly sites with Boostrap, and then we'll get some design tips to make your site look great.
